The aims of this project are as follows:

<ul>

 <li>To introduce you to building web services.</li>

 <li>To give you some familiarity with using the express.js web framework.</li>

</ul>

<h1>1.2        Requirements</h1>

You must push a submit/prj3-sol directory to your github repository such that typing npm ci within that directory is su cient to run the project using ./index.js.

You are being provided with an index.js which provides the required commandline behavior to start the program:

$ ./index.js PORT MONGO_DB_URL 

[ SENSOR_TYPES_JSON SENSORS_JSON SENSOR_DATA_JSON ] where the arguments are:

PORT     This required argument is the port at which the program listens for web requests.

MONGO_DB_URL This required argument is the url specifying the mongo database to be used by the program.

SENSOR_TYPES_JSON SENSORS_JSON SENSOR_DATA_JSON These three optional arguments specify the path to les containing JSON data representing the sensor types, sensors and sensor data respectively. If present, the data in the speci ed database is replaced by the data in these les.

What you speci cally need to do is add code to the provided sensors-ws.js such that your server recognizes the following 9 HTTP requests:

GET /sensor-types and GET /sensors The above URLs may include an optional query string. The following meta-parameters should be recognized within the query string:

_index       The starting index of the          rst returned data item (default 0).

_count          Maximum number of data items to be returned (default 5).

_doDetail This query parameter is meaningful only for the /sensors URL. If speci ed, then each returned sensor data item should have a sensorType property giving information about its sensor type.

Any additional query parameters should act as lter parameters to lter the returned data items. Speci cally, a returned data item must have properties with values identical to those speci ed for the lter query parameters.

A successful request at these urls should return a JSON representation of a JavaScript object having the following elds:

data This property is required. If the URL is /sensor-types, then data should give a list of sensor-type items. If the URL is /sensors then data should give a list of sensor-type items. Exactly what goes into a data item depends on the properties stored for a sensor-type or sensor, but minimally they should include the following properties:

id A unique ID for the sensor-type or sensor. The data items should be sorted in ascending lexicographical order by id.

self This should specify a URL which will return a result containing that exact item. self This property is required and should specify a URL which will return exactly the same results.

next This property is optional, but should be speci ed when there is a possibility for more results. If speci ed, it should specify a URL which will return the next batch of results for the same query.

prev This property is optional, but should be speci ed when there is a possibility for earlier results. If speci ed, it should specify a URL which will return the previous batch of results for the same query.

The next and prev URLs allow a client to go back-and-forth within the returned results.

If there are no results for a particular combination of lter parameters, then except for one case, the request should succeed with the data property returned as an empty list. The exceptional case is when an id is speci ed as a query parameter and there are no results. In that case, the request should fail with a 404 NOT_FOUND HTTP status code and the returned JSON object should contain a suitable errors list as de ned below.

GET /sensor-types/ID and GET /sensors/ID The behavior of these requests should be similar to the earlier requests except that a success result should contain exactly one data item with an id property matching ID. The entire result as well as the single data item should both have self URLs. There should not be any next and prev URLs as they do not make sense when only a single data item is expected.

When there are no results, these requests should fail with a 404 NOT_Â¬ FOUND HTTP status code and the returned JSON object should contain a suitable errors list as de ned below.

POST /sensor-types and POST /sensors These requests should be made with a JSON body specifying a sensor-type or sensor object which is to be added or replaced. The exact properties in the object being POSTed will depend on the data model, but should minimally include an id property.

A successful result should result in a 201 CREATED HTTP response. The response headers must include a Location header specifying a URL at which the newly created or replaced resource may be accessed.

GET /sensor-data/SENSOR_ID The above URL may include an optional query string. The following parameters should be recognized within the query string:

_count This meta-parameter gives the maximum number of data items to be returned (default 5).

_doDetail If this meta-parameter is speci ed, then the returned object should have sensor and sensorType properties giving details about the sensor and sensor-type producing the sensor-data.

timestamp This query parameter speci es an upper-bound on the timestamp of returned sensor-data items. If not speci ed, then it will default to the latest timestamp associated with the sensor speci ed by SENSOR_ID.

statuses This can be speci ed as ok, outOfRange, error or all with meaning as speci ed in Project 1. It should default to ok.

Other query parameters serve as lter query parameters to lter the returned data items. Speci cally, a returned data item must have properties with values identical to those speci ed for the lter query parameters.

A successful request at these urls should return a JSON representation of a JavaScript object having the following elds:

data This property is required and will be a list of sensor-data items for the speci ed SENSOR_ID. Each item must have a timestamp property giving the time of the reading with the items sorted in descending order by timestamp, a value property giving the value of the sensor reading and a status property specifying whether the reading was ok, outOfRange or error as speci ed in Project 1. Additionally, each item must have a self URL.

self This property is required and should specify a URL which will return exactly the same results.

If there are no results for a particular combination of lter parameters, then the request should succeed with the data property returned as an empty list. OTOH, if the SENSOR_ID is invalid, then the request should fail with a 404 NOT_FOUND HTTP status code and the returned JSON object should contain a suitable errors list as de ned below.

GET /sensor-data/SENSOR_ID/TIMESTAMP The behavior of this request should be very similar to the earlier request except that a success result should contain exactly one data item with a timestamp property matching TIMESTAMP. The returned sensor-data can have any status; i.e., unlike the earlier request statuses defaults to all.

The entire result as well as the single data item should both have self URLs.

When there are no results because of a non-existent SENSOR_ID or TIMESTAMP this request should fail with a 404 NOT_FOUND HTTP status code and the returned JSON object should contain a suitable errors list as de ned below.

POST /sensor-data/SENSOR_ID This requests should be made with a JSON body specifying a reading for sensor SENSOR_ID which is to be added or replaced. The object being POSTed must include a timestamp and value properties which meet the restrictions of the data model.

A successful result should result in a 201 CREATED HTTP response without any body. The response headers must include a Location header specifying a URL at which the newly created or replaced resource may be accessed.

Errors: If a request fails, then the returned response should have a suitable HTTP status code. The body for the error response should be the JSON representation of an object containing an errors property which should specify a non-empty list of error objects. Each error object should have code and message properties, where code is a brief code describing the error and message is a possibly context-dependent description of the error.

If the client accesses a URL di erent from any of those documented above, then the default error behavior provided by the web server framework is acceptable.

Additionally, the program should also log a suitable internal error object on standard error; this error object can contain internal details not exposed to the web service.

The behavior of the program is illustrated in this annotated log. Additionally, a working version of the project is available at <a href="http://zdu.binghamton.edu:2345">&lt;http://zdu.binghamton.edu:2345&gt; </a>(note that this URL will only work from within the campus network).

<h1>1.3        Provided Files</h1>

The prj3-sol directory contains a start for your project. It contains the following les:

sensors-ws.js This skeleton le constitutes the guts of your project. You will need to esh out the skeleton, adding code as per the documentation. You should feel free to add any auxiliary function or method de nitions as required.

sensors.js This le is adapted from the solution to Project 2. The only change is to have the findSensorTypes() and findSensors() return a previousIndex property to allow scrolling backwards in the results.

You should feel free to replace this le with that from your solution to Project 2 with suitable modi cations.

index.js This le provides the complete command-line behavior which is required by your program. It requires sensors.js and sensors-ws.js. You must not modify this le.

app-error.js A trival class for application errors.

validate.js Validation code from the previous project with a bug x which ensures that when findSensor() is provided with a period search parameter, then that period is treated as an integer.

README A README le which must be submitted along with your project. It contains an initial header which you must complete (replace the dummy entries with your name, B-number and email address at which you would like to receive project-related email). After the header you may include any content which you would like read during the grading of your project.

Additionally, the course data directory contains sensor data les. Itâs content is identical to the previous project.

<h1>1.4       Hints</h1>

You will need to use some kind of web service client for testing the services you are implementing. The recommended command-line client is <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl;</a> itâs use is illustrated by the sample log. There are no strong recommendations for GUI clients; possibilities include <a href="https://restlet.com/">restlet</a> and <a href="https://yet-another-rest-client.com/">yarc.</a>

The following steps are not prescriptive in that you may choose to ignore them as long as you meet all project requirements.

<ol>

 <li>Read the project requirements thoroughly. Look at the sample log to make sure you understand the necessary behavior. Review the material covered in class including the user-ws example and the <a href="https://expressjs.com/">js</a> documentation.</li>

</ol>

Based on the above, think seriously about how you would implement the project. Even though there are 9 separate methods, there is a lot of commonality between the methods. It is possible to factor out this commanality so that you need far fewer than 9 separate handlers. The fact that JavaScript allows rst-class functions makes the factoring out very easy.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Start your project by copying in the provided les into your work directory:</li>

</ol>

$ cd ~/i?44/work             #change into your work directory $ cp -pr $HOME/cs544/projects/prj3/prj3-sol .

This should copy in the README template, the index.js, the sensors.js le and the utility les app-error.js and validate.js as well as the sensors-ws.js skeleton le into a newly created work/prj3-sol directory.

<ol start="3">

 <li>Change into the newly created prj3-sol directory and initialize your project by running npm init. Speci cally:</li>

</ol>

$ cd prj3-sol

$ npm init -y

This will create a package.json                le; this    le should be committed to your repository.

<ol start="4">

 <li>Install necessary external packages cors, mongodb, express and body-Â¬ parser:</li>

</ol>

$ npm install mongodb cors express body-parser

The libraries and dependencies will be installed into a node_modules directory created within your current directory. It will also create a package-lock.json which must be committed into your git repository. The node_modules directory should not be committed to git.

<ol start="5">

 <li>You should be able to run the project enough to get a usage message:</li>

</ol>

$ ./index.js

usage: index.js PORT MONGO_DB_URL 

[ SENSOR_TYPES_JSON SENSORS_JSON SENSOR_DATA_JSON ]

<ol start="6">

 <li>Replace the XXX entries in the README template.</li>

 <li>Commit your project to github:</li>

</ol>

$ git add .

$ git commit -a -m âstarted prj3â

<ol start="8">

 <li>Unlike your previous projects, the provided sensors-ws.js skeleton le is extremely bare. To start with, work o the user-ws example covered in class to create an express app and have it listen on the speci ed port and print out a message with the listen handler.</li>

 <li>Again, working o the user-ws example, start adding routing to your code. Add a route to a handler for GET /sensor-type and use curl or a REST client to hit that handler. Use console.log() or a debugger to ensure that the handler gets hit.</li>

 <li>Add code to implement the full functionality for GET /sensor-types. Most of the work can be done by the sensors.findSensorType() method. You will just need to translate the web inputs (query parameters) to the input parameters to the method and the result of the method to a JSON web response. You will also need to translate any exceptions thrown by the method to suitable HTTP status codes and a JSON error response. For now, you can ignore the HATEOAS self, next and prev properties.</li>

</ol>

For error handling, catch any errors which are thrown by the underlying code, log them on standard error and massage them errors into the JSON required by the project speci cations. Again, use the error handling in the user-ws example as a guide.

Test using curl or any REST client until you have this working reasonably well.

<ol start="11">

 <li>Consider implementing GET /sensors. You should see that this is very similar to GET /sensor-types. Refactor your sensor-types code so that it can handle both sensor-types and sensors.</li>

 <li>Consider implementing GET /sensor-types/ID and GET /sensors/ID. Again, it may be possible to refactor your earlier handler to handle these too.</li>

 <li>Implement the POST /sensor-types/ and POST /sensors/ methods. Again, most of the work will be done by the sensors object. What you will need is to pull the passed-in data from the web request body and pass it into the corresponding sensor method.</li>

 <li>Implement the methods for sensor-data. These will be very similar to your earlier methods.</li>

 <li>Add support for the HATEOAS self, next and prev properties.</li>

 <li>Iterate until you meet all requirements.</li>

</ol>

It is a good idea to commit and push your project periodically whenever you have made signi cant changes. When it is complete please follow the procedure given in the github setup directions to submit your project using the submit directory.
